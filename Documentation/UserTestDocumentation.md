# User Test Insights

We conducted a user experience session with two participants, who were family members of one of our project team members. Their feedback provided valuable insights across various aspects of the application. Both participants praised the app's visual design, noting its sophistication and appealing colour scheme. They found the inclusion of machine metadata and occupancy count particularly helpful in making informed decisions. Additionally, they appreciated the notification system for alerting them to issues but suggested improvements to include notifications for issue resolution. The timer feature was highlighted as a useful tool for managing washing machine schedules. Furthermore, they commended the app's intuitive interface and effective error handling, which enhanced their overall user experience. This feedback from diverse users underscores the importance of considering different perspectives in evaluating and refining the application's user experience.

## Conclusion:

### Navigation and Usability:
The inclusion of an info icon to display instructions on how to use the app would be a thoughtful addition that enhances user guidance and navigation. This recommendation has been taken and a corresponding feature was implemented.

### Visual Design:
The application received praise for its visually appealing and sophisticated design, which incorporates pleasing colours and intuitive layouts. This aspect significantly contributes to the overall user experience by making the app visually engaging and easy to navigate.

### Metadata and Machine Information:
The application including machine metadata, such as machine status and occupancy count, serves in assisting users with decision-making and time management regarding machine availability and usage.

### Notification System:
Users appreciate the notification system for alerting them to issues with machine intensity. However, there's a suggestion to improve this system by including notifications for issue resolution for the intensity issue, thereby reducing the need for user intervention and enhancing overall convenience. This recommendation has been taken and a corresponding feature was implemented.

### Timer Feature:
The timer feature is highlighted as a valuable tool that aids users in managing their washing machine schedules effectively. Its inclusion in the app is praised for its functionality and usefulness in enhancing the user experience.

### Error Handling:
This proactive approach to error management enhances the app's interactivity and user experience by providing clear feedback and guidance to users during error scenarios.
