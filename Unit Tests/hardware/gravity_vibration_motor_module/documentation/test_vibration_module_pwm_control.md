# Vibration Motor Module Test Documentation

## Test Name: test_vibration_module_pwm_control

### Description
This document provides instructions for testing the basic functionality of a vibration motor module using an ESP32 microcontroller. The test gradually changes the vibration intensity to ensure that the motor is functioning correctly.

### Test Environment
- ESP32 DEVKITV1 micorcontroller
- Vibration motor module (Gravity DFROBOT).
- Jumper wires.

### Connection
- Connect the positive (VCC) wire if the vibration module to the Vin (5v) pin on the ESP32.
- Connect the negative (GND) wire of the vibration module to any GND pin on the ESP32.
- Connect the control signal wire of the vibration module to digital pin D23 on the ESP32.


### Test Steps
- Connect the vibration motor to the ESP32 as described in the "Connection" section.
- Connect the ESP32 to a power source.
- Upload the `test_vibration_motor_pwm_control.ino` code to the ESP32.
- Observe the behavior of the vibration module during the test.

### Expected Results
- The vibration motor should smoothly transition from low to high intensity and then from high to low intensity.

### Test Status
- &#x2611; Passed.
- &#x2610; Failed.

### Test Date
