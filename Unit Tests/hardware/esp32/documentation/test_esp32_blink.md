# ESP32 Blink Test Documentation

## Test Name: test_esp32_blink

### Description
The ESP32 Blink Test verifies the basic functionality of the ESP32 microcontroller by toggling the built-in LED on and off at one-second intervals. This test is essential to ensure that the microcontroller can control its GPIO pins correctly, including the built-in LED.

### Test Environment
- ESP32 DEVKITV1 microcontroller.
- No external components needed; uses the built-in LED on the ESP32.

### Test Steps
- Ensure the ESP32 is properly connected to your development environment.
- Connect the ESP32 to a power source.
- Upload the `test_esp32_blink.ino` code to the ESP32.
- Observe the behavior of the built-in LED.

### Expected Results
- The built-in LED on the ESP32 should blink on and off at one-second intervals.

### Test Status
- &#x2611; Passed.
- &#x2610; Failed.
