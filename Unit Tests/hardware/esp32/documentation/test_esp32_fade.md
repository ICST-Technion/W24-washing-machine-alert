### Description
The ESP32 Fade Built-in demonstrates how to fade the built-in LED on the ESP32 using the analogWrite() function. This test is crucial to ensure proper PWM and control of the LED's brightness.

### Test Environment
- ESP32 DEVKITV1 microcontroller.
- No external components needed; uses the built-in LED on the ESP32.

### Test Steps
- Ensure the ESP32 is properly connected to your development.
- Connect the ESP32 to a power source.
- Upload the `test_esp32_fade.ino` code to the ESP32.
- Observe the behavior of the built-in LED.

### Expected Results
- The build-in LED on the ESP32 should smoothly fade in and out.

### Test Status
- &#x2611; Passed.
- &#x2610; Failed.
